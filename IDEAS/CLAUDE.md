# Future Features and Ideas

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for features and enhancements planned for future versions. These were intentionally deferred from the initial release to maintain simplicity.

## Why These Were Deferred

### Complexity Reduction
The initial version focuses on working out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.

### User Feedback
Better to launch with core features and add complexity based on real usage.

### Maintenance Burden
Each configuration option increases testing and documentation needs.

### Learning Curve
Simple tools get adopted faster and create better user experiences.

## Implementation Considerations

### When to Add Features
- Clear user demand exists
- Feature solves real problems
- Implementation is maintainable
- Doesn't break existing usage

### How to Add Features
1. Start in IDEAS/ directory
2. Create detailed specification
3. Get user feedback
4. Implement with backward compatibility
5. Provide migration path

## Current vs Future

### Current (10 options)
```yaml
enabled: true
autoFix: true
validators:
  biome:
    enabled: true
    version: auto
    configPath: ./biome.json
  typescript:
    enabled: true
    configPath: ./tsconfig.json
include: ["src/**/*.ts"]
exclude: ["**/*.test.ts"]
logLevel: info
```

### Future (76+ options)
See `archived-configs/full-example-v2.yaml` for the complete complex configuration that was originally planned.

## Feature Requests

Track new feature ideas here before implementation:

### Under Consideration
- ESLint integration (high demand)
- Prettier support (competing with Biome)
- Git pre-commit integration
- VS Code extension
- Watch mode for development

### Rejected
- Real-time validation (conflicts with post-write design)
- GUI configuration tool (unnecessary complexity)
- Cloud-based validation (privacy concerns)

## Migration Path

When features move from IDEAS to implementation:
1. Update main documentation
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Provide clear upgrade guides
4. Default to previous behavior
5. Archive old IDEAS documentation

## Contributing Ideas

New ideas should:
- Solve real problems
- Fit the tool's philosophy
- Be technically feasible
- Not duplicate existing features
- Include use cases

## Note for Implementers

This directory is intentionally separate from main documentation. Features here are NOT commitments, just possibilities. Focus on executing the core 10-option configuration perfectly before considering additions.
