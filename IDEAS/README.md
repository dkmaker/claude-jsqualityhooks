# Future Features & Ideas

This directory contains features, optimizations, and ideas that are planned for future versions of Claude JS Quality Hooks but are NOT part of v1.

## Purpose

To keep v1 simple and focused (only 10 configuration options), we've moved all advanced features and ideas here for future implementation.

## Roadmap

### v1.0 (Current) - Essentials Only
- ✅ Basic enable/disable
- ✅ Auto-fix capability  
- ✅ Biome validation with version detection (1.x vs 2.x)
- ✅ TypeScript validation
- ✅ Include/exclude patterns
- ✅ Smart defaults for everything else

### v2.0 (Future) - Enhanced Control
- [ ] Hook configuration (timeout, failure strategies)
- [ ] Performance tuning (parallel processing, caching)
- [ ] Notification customization
- [ ] Severity level customization
- [ ] Fix priority configuration
- [ ] Rule-specific control

### v3.0 (Future) - Advanced Features
- [ ] AI-powered fix suggestions
- [ ] Adaptive learning from corrections
- [ ] Type error auto-fixing
- [ ] Custom rule creation
- [ ] Enterprise features
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies

## Contributing Ideas

If you have ideas for future features, please:
1. Check if it already exists in this directory
2. Consider which version it belongs to (v2 or v3)
3. Document the use case and benefits
4. Keep v1 simple - resist adding complexity too early

## Why This Separation?

- **v1 Focus**: Keep the initial version simple and reliable
- **Reduce Complexity**: 10 options instead of 76+
- **Clear Roadmap**: Users know what's coming
- **Preserve Ideas**: Nothing is lost, just deferred
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add complexity only when needed

## Using These Features

These features are NOT available in v1. To use them:
1. Wait for the appropriate version release
2. Or implement them in your own fork
3. Or submit a PR if you need them urgently

Remember: The goal of v1 is simplicity and reliability, not feature completeness.
