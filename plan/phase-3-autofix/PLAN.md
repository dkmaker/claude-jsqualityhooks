# Phase 3: Auto-Fix - Implementation Plan

## Phase Overview
Build the automatic fix system that applies safe fixes from Biome, handles conflicts, and verifies fixes were successful.

## Phase Goals
1. Implement safe fix application
2. Create conflict detection and resolution
3. Build file backup system
4. Add fix verification process
5. Ensure fixes are applied sequentially

## Tasks

### Task 1: Fix Engine Core
**File**: `plan/phase-3-autofix/task-01-fix-engine.md`
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

### Task 2: Conflict Resolution
**File**: `plan/phase-3-autofix/task-02-conflict-resolution.md`
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 1 complete

### Task 3: Fix Verification
**File**: `plan/phase-3-autofix/task-03-verification.md`
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 1 complete

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Biome fixes applied with correct flags
- [ ] Only safe fixes applied by default
- [ ] Sequential fix application
- [ ] File content updated correctly
- [ ] Verification after fixes
- [ ] No data loss

### Should Have
- [ ] Conflict detection between fixes
- [ ] Fix order optimization
- [ ] Rollback on failure
- [ ] Performance tracking

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Fix preview mode
- [ ] Selective fix application
- [ ] Fix history tracking

## Implementation Notes for Agent

1. **Create Your TODO List**
   - Track fix application steps
   - Monitor conflict scenarios
   - Verify each fix type

2. **Critical Safety**
   - NEVER apply unsafe fixes without explicit config
   - ALWAYS verify file after fixes
   - ALWAYS handle write failures

3. **Testing Focus**
   - Test with conflicting fixes
   - Test rollback scenarios
   - Test large files
   - Verify no data corruption

4. **Performance**
   - Sequential is safer than parallel
   - Cache fixed content
   - Minimize file I/O

## Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] All 3 tasks completed
- [ ] Biome fixes working
- [ ] File updates successful
- [ ] Verification passes
- [ ] Conflict handling tested
- [ ] No data loss scenarios
- [ ] Ready for Phase 4

## Handoff to Phase 4

When complete, Phase 4 can format:
- Fixed file content
- Remaining issues after fixes
- Fix statistics
- Success/failure status
