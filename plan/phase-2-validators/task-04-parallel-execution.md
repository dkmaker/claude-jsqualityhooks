# Task 4: Parallel Execution

## Task Overview
Implement parallel execution of Biome and TypeScript validators for optimal performance, with proper error handling and result aggregation.

- Pattern: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#L234-L238`
- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#L53-L56`
- Performance: `docs/features/01-hook-system.md#L95-L101`

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Task 2 (Biome Adapters) completed
- [ ] Task 3 (TypeScript Validator) completed
- [ ] Both validators working independently

## Implementation TODOs

### 1. Create Validator Manager
- [ ] Create src/validators/ValidatorManager.ts
- [ ] Accept config in constructor
- [ ] Initialize enabled validators
- [ ] Add validateFile method
- [ ] Return aggregated results
- Reference: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#L53-L56`

### 2. Implement Parallel Execution
- [ ] Use Promise.allSettled pattern
- [ ] Run Biome and TypeScript together
- [ ] Handle individual failures
- [ ] Collect all results
- [ ] Never fail completely
- Reference: `docs/features/01-hook-system.md#L24-L29`
- Reference: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#L234-L238`

### 3. Initialize Validators
- [ ] Check config.validators.biome.enabled
- [ ] Check config.validators.typescript.enabled
- [ ] Create validator instances
- [ ] Store in validators array
- [ ] Skip disabled validators

### 4. Execute Validators
- [ ] Create validation promises array
- [ ] Add each enabled validator
- [ ] Use Promise.allSettled
- [ ] Wait for all to complete
- [ ] Process settled results
- Reference: `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#L234-L238`

### 5. Handle Partial Failures
- [ ] Check each settled result
- [ ] Extract fulfilled values
- [ ] Log rejected reasons
- [ ] Continue with successful results
- [ ] Return partial validation
- Reference: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#L149-L162`

### 6. Aggregate Results
- [ ] Combine all validator results
- [ ] Merge issues arrays
- [ ] Calculate total counts
- [ ] Determine overall status
- [ ] Sort by file/line/column
- Reference: `docs/api/interfaces.md#L67-L72`

### 7. Add Performance Timing
- [ ] Record start time
- [ ] Record end time
- [ ] Calculate duration
- [ ] Log if over threshold
- [ ] Include in results
- Reference: `docs/features/01-hook-system.md#L95-L101`

### 8. Implement Result Caching
- [ ] Cache validation results
- [ ] Key by file path + content hash
- [ ] Expire after modifications
- [ ] Skip unchanged files
- [ ] Clear cache on config change

### 9. Create Validation Response
- [ ] Build ValidationResponse object
- [ ] Set overall status
- [ ] Include all issues
- [ ] Add statistics
- [ ] Include timing data
- Reference: `docs/api/interfaces.md#L48-L55`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Both validators run in parallel
- [ ] One validator failure doesn't block other
- [ ] Results properly aggregated
- [ ] Performance under 100ms typical
- [ ] Partial results returned
- [ ] No race conditions
- [ ] Memory efficient

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with both validators enabled
- [ ] Test with only Biome enabled
- [ ] Test with only TypeScript enabled
- [ ] Test with one validator failing
- [ ] Test with both validators failing
- [ ] Test performance with large files
- [ ] Test result aggregation

## Notes for Implementation Agent
1. Promise.allSettled is key - not Promise.all
2. Always return results even if partial
3. Performance is critical here
4. Don't wait sequentially
5. Cache if it helps performance
6. Log but don't throw errors
7. Aggregate issues intelligently
