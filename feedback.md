When the agent completes it's job it should evaluate the issues it saw - and if there is issues that it could have covered in advance by adding specific knowldge to the system prompt it should file a report in agent-feedback/<agent name>/<name of report>.md

It should follow the same template and the template should be defined in the system prompt of the actual agent

You just implemented the feedback for the error commands now make a plan to get this other pre complete status report section as well with same kind just seperate files pr. report instead of one file appending

Make a plan for that
